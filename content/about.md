# About me

Hey there! My name is Alex Ioannidis and I'm a developer interested in Python, the web, devops, popular culture and a whole bunch of other stuff.

I'm currently located in Geneva, Switzerland and working at CERN as the technical lead for [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), an open-access repository for the long tail of science. As part of that I'm also working on [Invenio](https://inveniosoftware.org), an open source framework for building digital repositories.

I started this blog for the occasional brain dump on stuff that I believe is cool to write and talk about. My opinions and views are not actually my own, but are whispered to me in my sleep by a *s e n t i e n t* burrito that lives under my bed. The burrito has assured me that its opinions and views are not the ones of my employer, and I trust it completely.

If you want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following communication channels:

- via email at <a.ioannidis@cern.ch>
- shoot me message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/slint)
- DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexIoPan)
- I often go around by the nickname `slint`, a tribute to the homonymous [post-rock pioneer band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint).

This blog is written in Markdown and is put together via a small Python script which uses [`mistune`](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) for Markdown processing, [`Pygments`](http://pygments.org/) for code highlighting and [`Jinja`](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) for some very basic templating. Source code can be found [on github](https://github.com/slint/slint.github.io).
