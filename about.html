  <h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Alex Ioannidis and I'm a software engineer currently working at CERN, on <a target="_blank" href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> - a research repository for the long tail of science. As part of that I'm also working on <a target="_blank" href="https://inveniosoftware.org">Invenio</a>, an open source framework for building digital repositories. I've mostly worked with Python, so it has become my &quot;internal thinking language&quot;, but I've also been playing around with Rust and Golang.</p>
<p>I started this blog for the occasional brain dump on stuff I find cool to write and talk about. My opinions and views are not actually my own, but are whispered to me in my sleep by a <em>s e n t i e n t</em> burrito that lives under my bed. The burrito has assured me that its opinions and views are not the ones of my employer, and I trust it completely.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following communication channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>via email at <a  href="mailto:a.ioannidis@cern.ch">a.ioannidis@cern.ch</a></li>
<li>DM me on <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AlexIoPan">X</a></li>
<li>I often go around by the nickname <code>slint</code>, a tribute to the homonymous <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint">post-rock pioneer band</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog is written in Markdown and is put together via a small Python script which uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune"><code>mistune</code></a> for Markdown processing, <a target="_blank" href="http://pygments.org/"><code>Pygments</code></a> for code highlighting and <a target="_blank" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/"><code>Jinja</code></a> for some very basic templating. Source code can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/slint/slint.github.io">on github</a>.</p>
